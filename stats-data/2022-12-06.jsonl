issue.\r\n\r\n### What product do you use?\r\n\r\nAdGuard for Android, AdGuard for Windows\r\n\r\n### AdGuard version\r\n\r\nAndroid 3.6.10 (51)\r\n\r\n### What type of problem have you encountered?\r\n\r\nWebsite or app doesn't work properly\r\n\r\n### Which browser(s) do you use?\r\n\r\nFirefox\r\n\r\n### Which device do you use?\r\n\r\nMobile\r\n\r\n### Where is the problem encountered?\r\n\r\nhttps://m.cafe.naver.com, https://cafe.naver.com, https://arca.live\r\n\r\n### What filters do you have enabled?\r\n\r\nAdGuard Base filter, AdGuard Mobile Ads filter, List-KR\r\n\r\n### What Stealth Mode options do you have enabled?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Add your comment and screenshots\r\n\r\nAdguard for Windows and android are all the same issues.\r\nThis problem continues with changes to mobile and PC devices.\r\n\r\nNot all times.\r\nImage loading failures often occur, and sometimes both PC and Android fail to load CSS, causing web pages to become unrecognizable.\r\n\r\nAt this time, everything worked fine when the Adguard filtering was turned off.\r\n\r\nMost of them load correctly, but sometimes they don't and it doesn't seem to be a problem with the filter list.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n<details><summary>Screenshot
