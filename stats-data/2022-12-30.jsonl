playing every 3 song as if their isn't even an ad blocker at all ! I tried using the \"Block ads on this site\" feature and clicked on the ad but it only removed the image and not the add ad itself.. This extension was working fine until around June 2022, i tried to be patient and tried redownloading it but that didn't help. It's now almost 2023 and i'm tired of this.
