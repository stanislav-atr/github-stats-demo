you use?\n\nAdGuard for Windows, Other ad blocker\n\n### AdGuard version\n\nAdGuard for Windows 7.11.1 + uBO 1.45.2\n\n### What type of problem have you encountered?\n\nWebsite or app doesn't work properly\n\n### Which browser(s) do you use?\n\nChrome\n\n### Which device do you use?\n\nDesktop\n\n### Where is the problem encountered?\n\nchrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/dashboard.html#3p-filters.html\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\nAdGuard Base filter, List-KR\n\n### What Stealth Mode options do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add your comment and screenshots\n\n1. I figured I should give a quick headsup that the attempt to add whitelistings in AdGuard Base for `/adservice.` currently aren't working entirely correctly, since uBO would sync List-KR from its own extension settings, instead of while the browser GUI is visiting any of the three `$domain=~` domains.\r\n\r\nI see two possible fixes:\r\n*My recommended way:* `@@/adservice.txt?_=` (Appears to work correctly in Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List.) + potentially `@@||adservice.io^$~third-party`?\r\n*An alternative way:* `@@||githubusercontent.com/*/adservice.` + `@@||github.com/*/adservice.` + `@@||adservice.io^`\r\n\r\n3.
