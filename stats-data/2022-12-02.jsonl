Расширения для браузера на компьютере не смотрел. Но проблема в том что в как в десктопной так и на мобильной внутри браузера не блокируют рекламу через нажатие на экран если не ошибаюсь называется click jacking. В uBlock origin нет такой проблемы, только у вас. Все новое все работает, фильтры почти все включены и обновлены все новая версия. Проблема не во мне и в моем телефоне проблема в том что он не блокирует рекламы через клики в \"пустых(невидимых) окнах\". Сайт предоставил 18+ потому что потому там все сразу ясно. Искать день другие. Так что ну извините \r\n\r\n### [NSFW] Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  [Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/ZCe8gFG.jpg)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Content Blocker v2.7.0\r\nBrowser: | Samsung Browser\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian\r\nOther extensions used: | uBlock origin ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/136406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/136406/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-12-02T07:15:52Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

В uBlock origin нет такой проблемы, только у вас. Все новое все работает, фильтры почти все включены и обновлены все новая версия. Проблема не во мне и в моем телефоне проблема в том что он не блокирует рекламы через клики в \"пустых(невидимых) окнах\". Сайт предоставил 18+ потому что потому там все сразу ясно.

Расширения для браузера на компьютере не смотрел. Но проблема в том что в как в десктопной так и на мобильной внутри браузера не блокируют рекламу через нажатие на экран если не ошибаюсь называется click jacking. В uBlock origin нет такой проблемы, только у вас. Все новое все работает, фильтры почти все включены и обновлены все новая версия. Проблема не во мне и в моем телефоне проблема в том что он не блокирует рекламы через клики в \"пустых(невидимых) окнах\". Сайт предоставил 18+ потому что потому там все сразу ясно.
