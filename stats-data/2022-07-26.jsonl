\r\n\r\nNo issues with google / cloudflare DNS **disabled** (as expected, no DNS is active)\r\n\r\nHowever, messages still fail to send with either google or cloudflare DNS enabled (with all custom filters disabled, nothing is blocked)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this behavior only starts happening the *second* time tiktok is opened with a DNS connected.\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. DNS is connected\r\n2. Tiktok is opened and a message is sent **successfully**\r\n3. Tiktok is closed and re-opened\r\n4. A message is sent **unsuccessfully** and not received by anyone\r\n5. This behavior proceeds to occur until the DNS is disabled\r\n\r\nSo, as this only starts happening the second time the app is opened, this seems to be a software-based limitation on tiktoks end, right?\r\nThere is no reason why it should only work the first time, unless tiktok give you that one time as leeway to turn off your DNS/VPN again.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1195281829/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-07-26T10:06:39Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}
