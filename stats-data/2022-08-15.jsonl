Comment\r\n> На рекламных баннерах в сафари наверное специально для адгвард написано \"реклама\", цинично так. \r\n> И эта реклама не глушится никак. \r\n> Адгвард недавно заставили меня купить версию \"про\", выкинул в помойку ещё чуть более 500 рублей \"навсегда\" и рекламы стало ещё больше. \r\n> Включено всё по вашей рекомендации, результатов ноль, рекламой заблёван весь смартфон. \r\n> Так же абсолютно не фильтруется трафик приложений, в играх, например, где после каждого уровня как дурилка на ниточке выскакивает какая-нибудь идиотская орущая реклама, по 30 секунд, которую никак не закрыть. \r\n> Адгвард ещё работает или сдались?\r\n> А вот эта капча перед отправкой сообщения - это что за архаизм?\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n

Prerequisites\n\n- [X] This site DOES NOT contains sexually explicit material, otherwise use [NSFW-specific form](./new?template=bug_report_NSFW.yml);\n- [X] Filters were updated before reproducing an issue;\n- [X] AdGuard product version is up-to-date;\n- [X] Browser version is up-to-date;\n- [X] If the site or app is broken, disabling AdGuard protection resolves an issue.\n\n### What product do you use?\n\nAdGuard DNS\n\n### AdGuard version\n\nadguard-dns.io\n\n### What type of problem have you encountered?\n\nWebsite or app doesn't work properly\n\n### Which browser(s) do you use?\n\nthe problem is with app, not a site\n\n### Which device do you use?\n\nMobile\n\n### Where is the problem encountered?\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music\n\n### What filters do you have enabled?\n\nAdGuard DNS filter\n\n### What Stealth Mode options do you have enabled?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Add your comment and screenshots\n\n##### To reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. With my DNS set to `c6-----.d.adguard-dns.com` in Android's settings.\r\n\r\n2. Open Spotify on the phone while playing songs on another device, it does not show the current playing song or controls for changing it. It does not download any song.\r\n\r\n3. Put something to play on the phone itself, then I don't see any new scrobbles on https://www.last.fm/user/PeHLC (even after songs ends).\r\n\r\n##### To temporarily fix it:\r\n\r\n4. Changes my DNS to `one.one.one.one` in Android's settings.\r\n\r\n5. Restarts Spotify on phone.\r\n\r\n6. Songs start to download, songs playing in other machines suddenly appears, past scrobbles are submitted to Last.fm and can be seen in my profile.\r\n\r\n##### Other details:\r\n\r\n1. I have a cookie in adguard-dns.io that says `user:\"32362--\"`\r\n\r\n2. Searching for Spotify blocked queries in statistics shows nothing in the past 7 days: https://adguard-dns.io/en/dashboard/statistics/query?limit=20&statuses%5B0%5D=REQUEST_BLOCKED&statuses%5B1%5D=RESPONSE_BLOCKED&companies%5B0%5D=spotify&retention=DAYS_7\r\n\r\n3.
