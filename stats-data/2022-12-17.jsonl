My iPhone is iPhone 7 Plus operating system 15.7.1 safari version 15.7.1\r\n\r\nAll I know is now if I click the updating button on the adguard app it saids no updates found. And the website is now detecting my adblocker every time no matter how many refreshes of the page I do. Could someone also please tell me what are the exact filters I must have enabled for in safari protection of the app in order for the added code Alex did to work? \r\n\r\nI have set up the six Adguard extensions on settings-safari of Aduard custom-Adguard general-Aduard other-Adguard privacy-Adguard security-Adguard-social \r\n\r\neach one is enabled \r\n\r\nI have gone to gaypornhdfree.com selected the aA icon on the left of the url bar of safari picked manage extensions and made sure adguard was enabled for advanced protection\r\n\r\nI also clicked on adguard on the list shown when you click aA and checked to make sure safari protection specifically for that website is enabled\r\n\r\nI have went also to setting-safari and selected\r\n\r\ndelete history and website data I have also selected close tabs afterwards \r\n\r\n\r\nI have added the user rule that Alex told me to add I have done everything I believe I was told of the exact order\r\n\r\nbut just in case could someone please direct me to the steps again of the exact order \r\n\r\nto make sure I have not missed a step or done it in the wrong order\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.
