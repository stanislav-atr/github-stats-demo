It prevents me from seeing any part of the video unless the AdGuard is disable.  I also noticed throughout the whole website random blank spaces are seen in specific spots. I believe these spaces are where ads are placed.  When I disable the AdGuard the ads will show up, but once it’s enable only black spaces remain in their spots. Before I have this issue, no blank spaces were shown.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/7ryIaTg.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard/AdGuard Pro for iOS v4.4.4\r\nBrowser: | Safari\r\nDNS filtering: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base, <br/>AdGuard Mobile Ads, <br/>EasyList<br/><br/><b>Privacy:</b><br/>Peter Lowe's Blocklist, <br/>AdGuard Tracking Protection, <br/>EasyPrivacy, <br/>Fanboy's Enhanced Tracking List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-Facebook List, <br/>Fanboy's Anti-thirdparty Fonts<br/><br/><b>Social Widgets:</b><br/>AdGuard Social Media, <br/>Fanboy's Social Blocking List<br/><br/><b>Annoyances:</b><br/>AdGuard Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Cookie Notices, <br/>AdGuard Popups, <br/>AdGuard Mobile App Banners, <br/>AdGuard Other Annoyances, <br/>AdGuard Widgets, <br/>Adblock Warning Removal List, <br/>Fanboy's Annoyances, <br/>Web Annoyances Ultralist, <br/>I don't care about cookies, <br/>EasyList Cookie List, <br/>Dandelion Sprout's Annoyances List<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion, <br/>AdGuard DNS, <br/>AdGuard Experimental","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/135904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/135904/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-27T03:06:25Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

Крч, проблема такова. Наскоько я понял, реклама добавлена в сам плеер. она звуковая, тоесть при нажатии треугольничка проигрывания, он начинает мне затирать про сайт по продаже кофт, или что-то типо того. реклама тематическая, тоесть добавлена и сделана конкретно для этого аниме сайта. её ни скипнуть, ни увидеть, ни отобразить на скриншоте. и пока её не прослушаешь, он не даёт посмотреть видео. любое видео на этом сайте. вот. и тоесть каждую серию надо слушать эту бяку\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/xecNMxH.png)\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\nInformation | value\r\n--- | ---\r\nAdGuard product: | AdGuard Browser extension v4.1.37\r\nBrowser: | YaBrowser\r\nStealth mode: | disabled\r\nFilters: | <b>Ad Blocking:</b><br/>AdGuard Base<br/><br/><b>Other:</b><br/>Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion<br/><br/><b>Language-specific:</b><br/>AdGuard Russian","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AdguardTeam/AdguardFilters/issues/comments/1328177709/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null}},"public":true,"created_at":"2022-11-27T05:56:52Z","org":{"id":8361145,"login":"AdguardTeam","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/AdguardTeam","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8361145?"}}

애드가드 문제 인 것 같네요.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Screenshot 1</summary>\r\n\r\n  ![Screenshot 1](https://reports-img.adguard.com/kQ5cAAz.png)\r\n</details>\r\n<details>\r\n
